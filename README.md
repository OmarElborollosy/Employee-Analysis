Employee Data Analysis
This repository contains Python code for analyzing employee data. We explore various aspects of the dataset, including age distribution, gender composition, and educational backgrounds.

Code Overview

Data Loading and Exploration:
We load the employee data from a CSV file (Employee.csv).
Check the shape of the dataset and examine the column names.
Explore the distribution of ages in the dataset.
Age Analysis:
Randomly sample ages from the dataset.
Calculate the sample mean and construct a confidence interval for the population mean age.
Use statistical methods to estimate the true mean age.
Gender Analysis:
Replace gender codes (0 for Female, 1 for Male) with descriptive labels.
Count the number of female employees in the company.
Create a sample of gender data and calculate a confidence interval for the proportion of female employees.
Education Analysis:
Replace education level codes (0 for Bachelors, 1 for Masters, 2 for PHD) with descriptive labels.
Count the number of employees with Bachelors degrees in the company.
Create a sample of education data and calculate a confidence interval for the proportion of employees with Bachelors degrees.
Masters Degree Analysis:
Replace education level codes again (for consistency).
Count the number of employees with Masters degrees in the company.
Create a sample of education data and calculate a confidence interval for the proportion of employees with Masters degrees.
